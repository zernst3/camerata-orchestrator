# Overnight autonomous run — decisions needed + progress log

Started 2026-10-20 (Zach logged off; autonomous continuation of the master sequence).
Zach reviews this in the morning. I commit locally; I cannot push unattended, so every
commit sits on the branch ready for review + push.

## DECISIONS NEEDED (Zach)

(none yet)

## PROGRESS (newest first)

- 2026-10-20: Design docs extended per Zach's mid-session asks: machine-readable exports now
  include a root `manifest.json` (index + sha256 + schema versions + provenance incl.
  client-visible `rules_last_reviewed` from the staleness watermark). README confirmed to carry
  only PARTIAL metadata today (purposes/repos/generated); will mirror the new provenance lines.
  Design committed; BUILD sequenced after W27.
- 2026-10-20: Zach sequencing ruling — Track 2 (exports+manifest, staleness, W23/W24) folds in
  BEFORE the next graded sweep, and the GRADER gets a thoroughness/strictness revision for the
  new product type (package, not just scan+PDF) before the sweep. Grader MODEL stays fixed; the
  RUBRIC gets stricter. Recorded as plan items 19e + 19f, gating item 20 (the sweep).
